# Welcome to Positron

Positron is another IDE for Python, designed with a very particular set of tastes in
mind. By using Positron, you are adventurously looking for a new experience from your
IDE. Please note that Positron is still in very early development.

This help file is generated every time you open Positron. If for any reason you wish to

### Configuration and settings

The Positron configuration folder (shortened to `#/`) contains all of your personal
files regarding Positron: settings, cached session data, logs, etc. Most importantly are
the settings files. Just browsing the settings file (`#/settings/settings.toml`) will
give you some idea of what can be done with positron.


### Getting started

Positron never expects you to remove your hands from the keyboard, and so becoming
familiar with the hotkeys is important.
