# NIDE - Another Python IDE

A personal (*i.e.* very opinionated) IDE for Python.

### Why does this exist?
My criteria for a good Python IDE:
- **Fully FLOSS** (*e.g.* VSCode is proprietary)
- **Customizable** for my needs (*e.g.* keyboard hotkeys and linting config)
- **Easy** to install and maintain (*e.g.* Vim with 25 plugins doesn't count)
- **Lightweight** with syntax and linting only (*e.g.* no debuggers or plugins)

Atom was killed and hence, here we are.

### Why is this so uncomfortable to use/develop?
This is currently being developed specifically and exclusively
for my personal needs and preferences. I would be glad to accept
contributions if they fit with the vision.
